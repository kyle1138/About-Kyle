      <div id="Description">
        <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Post graduation I teamed up with other GA grads to collaborate on a service
          that receives and sorts marketing emails. I contributed throughout the stack, including the rails backend,
          setting up the post route for the Sendgrid API, and jQuery on the front end. This is still a work in progress.

      <h2 class = "pTitle">Food and Nutritional Journal</h2>
      <div id="Description">
        <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I made a food journal that tracks total calorie consumption,
          and calories by type. Users can make accounts, search for food items using the Nutritionix API,
          and then add an amount in grams. Users have access to future and past dates in order to delete
          food entries, add entries, or just review what they ate.

    <h2 class = "pTitle">Chat Room</h2>
    <div id="Description">
      <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;My first major project was a fully functioning chat app.
        Using websockets and DOM manipulation, multiple users can connect , converse with text,
        share links, and render images directly in the message pane. Other features
        of the app include fun ASCII art commands, restricted words, and a whisper command
        that would allow users to send messages that can only bee seen by another specific user.

    <h2 class = "pTitle">E-Reader</h2>
      <div id="Description">
        <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;My second project was a group collaboration
          on a simple e-reader app. We set up an http server that built pages by pulling
          lines from txt files to create a user experience not similar to that of a
          Nook or Kindle. There are some subtle javascript effects to make the page
          turning experience seem a little less artificial.
